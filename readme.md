I used the api from [randomfox](https://randomfox.ca/) to make this program.
This program is not finished.

**TO-DO:**
- Add button to reload image
- Test on different platforms
- Fix and release as .exe

**I have been unable to successfully convert this to a .exe file, it will convert but not run** <br>
**I have been using auto-py-to-exe and get this error message:** <br>
