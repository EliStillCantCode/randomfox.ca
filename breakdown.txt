"tkinter" is used to make windows
"requests" is used for communication with API's
"ImageTk" and "Image" are for adding images into a tkinter window
"BytesIO" converts byte arrays into images

"tkinter.Tk()" makes a window and is assigned to variable "root"
"root.title()" sets a title for the window
"root.iconbitmap()" sets a .ico to display to the left of the title

".json()" turns the output of the api response into a dictionary
"['image']" takes the image url from the dictionary
download the image data from the url
".content" isolates the byte array

turn the bytes into an image with BytesIO
convert the image into an image compatible with tkinter
add the tk-compatible image to a "label"
"pack" (add) the label to the window ((display the image))

"root.mainloop()" keeps the window open until closed by the user
